# Aerospike restore (abs-restore-cli)
Aerospike Restore CLI tool. This page describes capabilities and configuration options of the Aerospike restore tool, `abs-restore-cli`.

## Overview
`abs-restore-cli` restores backups created with `abs-backup-cli`. With the `abs-restore-cli` tool, you can restore to specific bins or sets, secure connections using username/password credentials or TLS (or both), and use configuration files to automate restore operations.

## Considerations for Aerospike restore
When using `abs-restore-cli`, be aware of the following considerations:

- The TTL of restored keys is preserved, but the last-update-time and generation count are reset to the current time.
- `abs-restore-cli` creates records from the backup. If records exist in the namespace on the cluster, you can configure a write policy to determine whether the backup records or the records in the namespace take precedence when using `abs-restore-cli`.
- If a restore transaction fails, you can configure timeout options for retries.
- Restore is cluster-configuration-agnostic. A backup can be restored to a cluster of any size and configuration. Restored data is evenly distributed among cluster nodes, regardless of cluster configuration.

## Privileges required for `abs-restore-cli`
The privileges required to run `abs-restore-cli` depend on the type of objects in the namespace.

- If the namespace does not contain [user-defined functions](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/udf) or [secondary indexes](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/data-storage/secondary-index), `read-write` is the minimum necessary privilege.
- If the namespace contains [user-defined functions](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/udf), `udf-admin` is the minimum necessary privilege to restore UDFs for Database 6.0 or later. Otherwise, use `data-admin`.
- If the namespace contains [secondary indexes](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/data-storage/secondary-index), `sindex-admin` is the minimum necessary privilege to restore secondary indexes for Database 6.0 or later. Otherwise, use `data-admin`.

      --auth INTERNAL,EXTERNAL,PKI                                                                  The authentication mode used by the Aerospike server. INTERNAL 
                                                                                                    uses standard user/pass. EXTERNAL uses external methods (like LDAP) 
                                                                                                    which are configured on the server. EXTERNAL requires TLS. PKI allows 
                                                                                                    TLS authentication and authorization based on a certificate. No 
                                                                                                    username needs to be configured. (default INTERNAL)
      --tls-enable                                                                                  Enable TLS authentication with Aerospike. If false, other TLS 
                                                                                                    options are ignored.

                                                                                                    Aerospike.
      --tls-cafile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                       The CA used when connecting to Aerospike.
      --tls-capath <cert-path-name>                                                                 A path containing CAs for connecting to Aerospike.
      --tls-certfile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                     The certificate file for mutual TLS authentication with 
                                                                                                    Aerospike.
      --tls-keyfile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                      The key file used for mutual TLS authentication with Aerospike.
      --tls-keyfile-password "env-b64:<env-var>,b64:<b64-pass>,file:<pass-file>,<clear-pass>"       The password used to decrypt the key file if encrypted.
      --tls-protocols "[[+][-]all] [[+][-]TLSv1] [[+][-]TLSv1.1] [[+][-]TLSv1.2] [[+][-]TLSv1.3]"   Set the TLS protocol selection criteria. This format is the same 
                                                                                                    as Apache's SSLProtocol documented at 
                                                                                                    https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol (default +TLSv1.2)
      --services-alternate                                                                          Determines if the client should use "services-alternate" instead 
                                                                                                    of "services" in info request during cluster tending.
      --client-timeout int         Initial host connection timeout duration. The timeout when opening a connection
                                   to the server host for the first time. (default 30000)
      --client-idle-timeout int    Idle timeout. Every time a connection is used, its idle
                                   deadline will be extended by this duration. When this deadline is reached,
                                   the connection will be closed and discarded from the connection pool.
                                   The value is limited to 24 hours (86400s).
                                   It's important to set this value to a few seconds less than the server's proto-fd-idle-ms
                                   (default 60000 milliseconds or 1 minute), so the client does not attempt to use a socket
                                   that has already been reaped by the server.
                                   Connection pools are now implemented by a LIFO stack. Connections at the tail of the
                                   stack will always be the least used. These connections are checked for IdleTimeout
                                   on every tend (usually 1 second).
                                   
      --client-login-timeout int   Specifies the login operation timeout for external authentication methods such as LDAP. (default 10000)

  -s, --set-list string               Only restore the given sets from the backup.
                                      Default: restore all sets.
  -B, --bin-list string               Only restore the given bins in the backup.
                                      If empty, include all bins.
  -R, --no-records                    Don't restore any records.

      --no-udfs                       Don't restore any UDFs.
  -w, --parallel int                  The number of restore threads. Accepts values from 1-1024 inclusive.
                                      If not set, the default value is automatically calculated and appears as the number of CPUs on your machine.
  -L, --records-per-second int        Limit total returned records per second (RPS). If 0, no limit is applied.
      --max-retries int               Maximum number of retries before aborting the current transaction. (default 5)
      --total-timeout int             Total transaction timeout (in ms). If 0, no timeout is applied.  (default 10000)
      --socket-timeout int            Socket timeout (in ms). If 0, the value for --total-timeout is used.
                                      If both this and --total-timeout are 0, there is no socket idle time limit. (default 10000)
      --nice int                      The limits for read/write storage bandwidth in MiB/s.
                                      Default is 0 (no limit). (DEPRECATED: use --bandwidth instead)
  -N, --bandwidth int                 The limits for read/write storage bandwidth in MiB/s.
                                      Default is 0 (no limit).
  -T, --info-timeout int              Set the timeout (in ms) for asinfo commands sent from abs-restore-cli to the database.
                                      The info commands are to check version, get indexes, get udfs, count records, and check batch write support. (default 10000)
      --info-retry-interval int       Set the initial interval for a retry (in ms) when info commands are sent. (default 1000)
      --info-retry-multiplier float   Increases the delay between subsequent retry attempts.
                                      The actual delay is calculated as: info-retry-interval * (info-retry-multiplier ^ attemptNumber) (default 1)
      --info-max-retries uint         Number of retries to send info commands before failing. (default 3)
      --std-buffer int                Buffer size in MiB for stdin and stdout operations. Used for pipelining. (default 4)
  -i, --input-file string         Restore from a single backup file. Use '-' for stdin.
                                  Required, unless --directory or --directory-list is used.
                                  
      --directory-list string     A comma-separated list of paths to directories that hold the backup files. Required,
                                  unless -i or -d is used. The paths may not contain commas.
                                  Example: 'abs-restore-cli --directory-list /path/to/dir1/,/path/to/dir2'
                                  
      --parent-directory string   A common root path for all paths used in --directory-list.
                                  This path is prepended to all entries in --directory-list.
                                  Example: 'abs-restore-cli --parent-directory /common/root/path
                                  --directory-list /path/to/dir1/,/path/to/dir2'
                                  
  -u, --unique                    Skip modifying records that already exist in the namespace.
  -r, --replace                   Fully replace records that already exist in the namespace.
                                  This option still performs a generation check by default and needs to be combined with the -g option
                                  if you do not want to perform a generation check.
                                  This option is mutually exclusive with --unique.
  -g, --no-generation             Don't check the generation of records that already exist in the namespace.
      --ignore-record-error       Ignore errors specific to records, not UDFs or indexes. The errors are:
                                  AEROSPIKE_RECORD_TOO_BIG,
                                  AEROSPIKE_KEY_MISMATCH,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_NAME_TOO_LONG,
                                  AEROSPIKE_ALWAYS_FORBIDDEN,
                                  AEROSPIKE_FAIL_FORBIDDEN,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_TYPE_ERROR,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_NOT_FOUND.
                                  By default, these errors are not ignored and abs-restore-cli terminates.
      --disable-batch-writes      Disables the use of batch writes when restoring records to the Aerospike cluster.
                                  By default, the cluster is checked for batch write support. Only set this flag if you explicitly
                                  don't want batch writes to be used or if abs-restore-cli is failing to work because it cannot recognize
                                  that batch writes are disabled.
                                  
      --max-async-batches int     To send data to Aerospike Database, abs-restore-cli creates write workers that work in parallel.
                                  This value is the number of workers that form batches and send them to the database.
                                  For Aerospike Database versions prior to 6.0, 'batches' are only a logical grouping of records,
                                  and each record is uploaded individually.
                                  The true max number of async Aerospike calls would then be <max-async-batches> * <batch-size>.
                                   (default 32)
      --warm-up int               Warm Up fills the connection pool with connections for all nodes. This is necessary for batch restore.
                                  By default is calculated as (--max-async-batches + 1), as one connection per node is reserved
                                  for tend operations and is not used for transactions.
                                  
      --batch-size int            The max allowed number of records to simultaneously upload to Aerospike.
                                  Default is 128 with batch writes enabled. If you disable batch writes,
                                  this flag is superseded because each worker sends writes one by one.
                                  All three batch flags are linked. If --disable-batch-writes=false,
                                  abs-restore-cli uses batch write workers to send data to the database.
                                  abs-restore-cli creates a number of workers equal to --max-async-batches that work in parallel,
                                  and form and send a number of records equal to --batch-size to the database.
                                   (default 128)
      --extra-ttl int             For records with expirable void-times, add N seconds of extra-ttl to the
                                  recorded void-time.
                                  
      --retry-base-interval int   Set the initial interval for a retry (in ms) when data is sent to the Aerospike database
                                  during a restore. This retry sequence is triggered by the following non-critical errors:
                                  AEROSPIKE_NO_AVAILABLE_CONNECTIONS_TO_NODE,
                                  AEROSPIKE_TIMEOUT,
                                  AEROSPIKE_DEVICE_OVERLOAD,
                                  AEROSPIKE_NETWORK_ERROR,
                                  AEROSPIKE_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BATCH_FAILED,
                                  AEROSPIKE_MAX_ERROR_RATE.
                                  This base timeout value is also used as the interval multiplied by --retry-multiplier to increase
                                  the timeout value between retry attempts. (default 1000)
